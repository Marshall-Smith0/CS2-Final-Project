Welcome to the MathBot!

The program was created as a learning tool for kindergarteners. You will be given 5 problems that will have 2 numbers 
randomly generated. You must find the sum of these 2 numbers and Jaiden, the MathBot, will tell you if you are right or 
wrong. 

If you get the answer wrong, press the clear button and try again.
If you get the answer right, there is no need to press the clear button, just press the next button to go to the next problem. 

I hope you ennjoy playing with the MathBot, and I hope you learn a lot from this experience.
